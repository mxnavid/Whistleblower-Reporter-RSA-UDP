    ============= Feedback ============================

    How many hours in total did you spend on this assignment?

        Include reading time, research time, coding time, AND test/debug time.
        Total           = 18 hours.
        Reading Time    = 2 hours.
        Research Time   = 5 hours.
        Coding time     = 8 hours.
        Test/Debug Time = 3 hours.

    What did I learn?
    I learned RSA encryption and decryption with a practical example, learned how to use the
    thread to make sure that the incoming messages are always received (reporter) just like
    we are receiving instant messages in our phone.

    What was easy about this assignment?
    Sending and receiving ONE message from client to server is pretty easy using Datagram.
    The concept of the project about message transfer was easy.

    What gave you trouble? Describe specific problems, you had, if any.
    I initially was confused about the Encryption and Decryption process. Like
    what is the use of mod and exponent and am I doing it really in the right way.
    The other part way setting up the seed. I thought creating an empty array is equivalent
    of array with bunch of 0. Also, the ciphertext and plaintext usage in the writeup was
    kind of confusing. But after getting clarification I understood that it's only use case
    for RSA encryption and decryption testing.

    What can the instructor do to improve this assignment?
    Including the formula for Encryption and Decryption in the project write-up will
    make it a bit convenient. I used handout and office hour to get clarified about that.

    Would you have liked to add or do anything further?
    Overall it was a very informative project. I was challenged and learned a lot during the
    whole process.
